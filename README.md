Simple Kanban
=============

A very simple basic Kanban board. We are mainly using it to track projects and their status. This would be great for a program manager. It's super easy to use, needs only a very basic PHP webserver.

Editing projects is done inline. One click and there you go.

It's also possible to easily iFrame this into other platforms (e.g. Sharepoint).

Works in IE8+, Chrome and Firefox.
